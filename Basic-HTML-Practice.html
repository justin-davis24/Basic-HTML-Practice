        <h2>What is Web Application Development About?</h2>
        <p>Web Application is about making websites using different types of coding or programming languages.</p>
        <p>A couple of examples would be:
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>Python</li>
        <p>Another example would be something like:</p>
            <ul><em>HTML</em></ul>
            <p>The difference between the first few and <em>HTML</em> is, <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong> are coding languages whereas <em>HTML</em> is just a programming language</p>
            <p>Here's a more in depth slideshow to explain the basics of Web Application Development: <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1C3kPq13Idavi75QUGwMNQOHgAZVfwVhUbAw0bsVi85U/edit#slide=id.p">Intro to Web Dev 1 - Files and Tags</a></p>
